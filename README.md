Description of Project

For our project we are doing a simple version of Pokemon.  The user will be given Pikachu as their starting pokemon for battling.  Afterwards, the user will be allowed to travel through a map where they will encounter wild Pokemon in the grass, with the kind of Pokemon they encounter being generated by a random number generator.  The Pokemons will have a certain moveset and the damage that the wild Pokemon do will be based on a random number generator.  If the type of the enemy pokemon is weak/strong to the type of the starter pokemon, the damage will be lowered or increased respectively.  The user will also be able to meet the gym master which is essentially the boss battle.  The user will be allowed to interact with several NPCs throughout the map and also be able to go into some of the houses by going to the door and pressing "X".  If the user wishes to leave the house, just stand at the doormat and press "X" again.
